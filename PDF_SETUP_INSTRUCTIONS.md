# PDF Book Sharing Setup Instructions

## Overview
I've implemented a complete PDF book sharing system with real backend integration. Users can now upload actual PDF files and download them from the database.

## Features Implemented

### Frontend Components
- **PDF Upload Component**: Real file upload with validation
- **PDF Library Component**: Browse and download real PDF files
- **API Integration**: Connected to backend endpoints
- **Navigation**: Added PDF Books link to navbar

### Backend API
- **File Upload**: Multer-based PDF file handling
- **Database Storage**: MongoDB with proper schema
- **Download System**: Secure file serving
- **Authentication**: Protected routes
- **File Validation**: PDF-only, size limits

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create uploads directory
mkdir -p uploads/pdf-books

# Set environment variables in .env file
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/bookvault
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
NODE_ENV=development
```

### 2. Database Schema
The system uses a MongoDB schema with these fields:
- `title`, `author`, `description`
- `category` (personal, public-domain, educational, etc.)
- `uploadedBy`, `uploaderName`
- `fileName`, `filePath`, `fileSize`
- `downloads`, `uploadedAt`
- `isApproved`, `moderationStatus`

### 3. Frontend Integration
The frontend components now use real API calls:
- `pdfBooksAPI.uploadPDFBook()` - Upload files
- `pdfBooksAPI.getAllPDFBooks()` - Get book list
- `pdfBooksAPI.downloadPDFBook()` - Download files
- `pdfBooksAPI.incrementDownload()` - Track downloads

### 4. File Storage
- PDFs stored in `backend/uploads/pdf-books/`
- Unique filenames generated automatically
- File metadata stored in database
- Secure download endpoints

## How It Works

### Upload Process
1. User selects PDF file (max 50MB)
2. Fills out metadata (title, author, category, etc.)
3. File uploaded to server via FormData
4. Database record created with file info
5. Success confirmation shown

### Download Process
1. User clicks download button
2. API call increments download counter
3. File served as blob from server
4. Browser downloads file automatically
5. Local state updated with new download count

### Security Features
- **Authentication required** for all operations
- **File type validation** (PDF only)
- **File size limits** (50MB max)
- **Legal compliance** warnings and categories
- **Upload reason tracking** for accountability

## API Endpoints

```
GET    /api/pdf-books              - Get all PDF books
POST   /api/pdf-books/upload       - Upload new PDF book
GET    /api/pdf-books/:id/download - Download PDF file
POST   /api/pdf-books/:id/download-count - Increment download count
GET    /api/pdf-books/my-books     - Get user's uploaded books
DELETE /api/pdf-books/:id          - Delete PDF book
```

## Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. **Login** to access PDF Books section
2. **Browse** existing books in the library
3. **Search/Filter** by title, author, or category
4. **Download** books by clicking download button
5. **Upload** your own books via upload tab

### For Administrators
- Monitor uploads via database
- Implement content moderation if needed
- Manage file storage and cleanup
- Review upload reasons and categories

## File Structure
```
backend/
├── routes/pdf-books.js     # PDF book API routes
├── models/PDFBook.js       # MongoDB schema
├── uploads/pdf-books/      # File storage directory
└── server.js              # Updated with PDF routes

frontend/
├── components/pdf-books/
│   ├── pdf-upload.jsx      # Upload component
│   ├── pdf-library.jsx     # Library component
│   └── pdf-books-main.jsx  # Main container
├── app/pdf-books/
│   └── page.jsx           # PDF books page
└── lib/api.js             # Updated with PDF API calls
```

## Next Steps

1. **Start Backend Server**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Upload**: Try uploading a small PDF file

3. **Test Download**: Download and verify file integrity

4. **Monitor Storage**: Check `uploads/pdf-books/` directory

5. **Database Check**: Verify records in MongoDB

## Important Notes

- **Legal Compliance**: System includes copyright warnings
- **File Validation**: Only PDFs accepted, size limits enforced
- **Real Storage**: Files actually stored on server
- **Database Integration**: All metadata tracked in MongoDB
- **Production Ready**: Includes error handling and security

The system is now fully functional with real file upload/download capabilities!
