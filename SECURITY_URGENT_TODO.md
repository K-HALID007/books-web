# üö® URGENT SECURITY ACTIONS REQUIRED

## COMPLETED ‚úÖ
- [x] Removed .env files from Git tracking
- [x] Updated .gitignore to prevent future .env commits
- [x] Generated new JWT secret
- [x] Committed and pushed changes

## STILL REQUIRED ‚ö†Ô∏è

### 1. Change MongoDB Password (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Log into MongoDB Atlas: https://cloud.mongodb.com/
- [ ] Navigate to Database Access
- [ ] Change password for user 'test'
- [ ] Update MONGO_URI in backend/.env with new password

### 2. Update Local Environment
- [ ] Update backend/.env with new MongoDB password
- [ ] Test database connection

### 3. Consider Git History Cleanup (RECOMMENDED)
Your .env files are still in Git history. For a public repo, consider:
- [ ] Use BFG Repo-Cleaner to remove sensitive files from history
- [ ] Or create a new repository and migrate code

### 4. Security Best Practices Going Forward
- [ ] Never commit .env files
- [ ] Use environment variables in production
- [ ] Regular security audits
- [ ] Consider using secrets management tools

## Current Status
- Repository is now secure for new commits
- Old commits still contain sensitive data
- Database credentials need immediate change
