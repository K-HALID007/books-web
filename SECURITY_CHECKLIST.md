- [x] User input validation

### 2. Rate Limiting
- [x] General API rate limiting (100 requests per 15 minutes)
- [x] Authentication rate limiting (5 attempts per 15 minutes)
- [x] File upload rate limiting (10 uploads per hour)

### 3. Input Validation & Sanitization
- [x] MongoDB injection prevention
- [x] XSS protection
- [x] HTTP Parameter Pollution prevention
- [x] File upload validation
- [x] Request size limits

### 4. Security Headers
- [x] Helmet.js for security headers
- [x] Content Security Policy
- [x] HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
- [x] X-Frame-Options
- [x] X-Content-Type-Options

### 5. File Upload Security
- [x] File type validation
- [x] File size limits
- [x] Malicious filename detection
- [x] Path traversal prevention
- [x] Executable file blocking

### 6. CORS Configuration
- [x] Restricted origins
- [x] Specific allowed methods
- [x] Controlled headers

### 7. Error Handling
- [x] No sensitive information in error messages
- [x] Proper error logging
- [x] Generic error responses in production

### 8. Data Protection
- [x] Environment variables for sensitive data
- [x] Password field exclusion in responses
- [x] Secure session handling

## üö® CRITICAL: Before Deployment

### 1. Environment Variables
**MUST CHANGE THESE VALUES:**

```bash
# Generate a strong JWT secret (32+ characters)
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secure_jwt_secret_key_change_this_to_random_32_chars_minimum_before_deployment

# Update MongoDB credentials
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://your_username:your_secure_password@your_cluster.mongodb.net/your_database

# Set production environment
NODE_ENV=production

# Set your actual frontend URL
FRONTEND_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

### 2. Generate Secure JWT Secret
Run this command to generate a secure JWT secret:
```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

### 3. Database Security
- [ ] Change default MongoDB credentials
- [ ] Enable MongoDB authentication
- [ ] Use MongoDB Atlas with IP whitelisting
- [ ] Enable MongoDB encryption at rest

### 4. Server Configuration
- [ ] Use HTTPS in production
- [ ] Configure reverse proxy (Nginx/Apache)
- [ ] Set up SSL certificates
- [ ] Configure firewall rules

### 5. Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Set up error monitoring (Sentry, LogRocket)
- [ ] Configure access logs
- [ ] Monitor failed login attempts
- [ ] Set up alerts for suspicious activity

## üõ°Ô∏è Additional Security Recommendations

### 1. Infrastructure Security
- [ ] Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- [ ] Enable DDoS protection
- [ ] Regular security updates
- [ ] Backup strategy

### 2. Code Security
- [ ] Regular dependency updates
- [ ] Security vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Code review process
- [ ] Penetration testing

### 3. Operational Security
- [ ] Secure deployment pipeline
- [ ] Access control for production
- [ ] Regular security audits
- [ ] Incident response plan

## üîç Security Testing Commands

### 1. Check for vulnerabilities
```bash
npm audit
npm audit fix
```

### 2. Test rate limiting
```bash
# Test auth rate limiting
for i in {1..10}; do curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"test@test.com","password":"wrong"}'; done
```

### 3. Test file upload security
```bash
# Try uploading non-PDF file
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/pdf-books/upload -F "pdf=@malicious.exe" -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

## üö® Security Incident Response

If you detect a security breach:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Change all passwords and secrets
   - Revoke all active JWT tokens
   - Block suspicious IP addresses
   - Take affected systems offline if necessary

2. **Investigation:**
   - Check server logs
   - Identify the attack vector
   - Assess data exposure
   - Document the incident

3. **Recovery:**
   - Patch vulnerabilities
   - Restore from clean backups
   - Update security measures
   - Monitor for continued attacks

4. **Communication:**
   - Notify affected users
   - Report to authorities if required
   - Update security documentation

## üìû Emergency Contacts

- System Administrator: [Your Contact]
- Security Team: [Security Contact]
- Hosting Provider: [Provider Support]

**Remember:** Security is an ongoing process, not a one-time setup. Regularly review and update your security measures.
